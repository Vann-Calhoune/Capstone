# GOAT Takes

## Overview

This is my capstone project I completed while attending Savvy Coders' Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. It is a full stack web application using HTML, CSS and Javascript on the front end, Node.js and Express.js on the backend, Heroku to make API calls and MongoDB as a database. Its a blogging website with the ability to rank the NBA's 75th anniversary team and compare two players' season statistics. 

## Home

This page contains my takes on certain NBA topics and hot news around the league. You can click on a post and it will take you to a full article with a comment section. At the bottom of the post is the ability to leave new comments.

## Rank

This page allows you to rank the NBA's 75th anniversary team. The page uses drag and drop functionality to move players into the ranking table. 

## Compare

This page allows you to enter two former or current NBA players' names and select a season for each. Once you click submit, the table on the page will then populate with the slected playeers stats for the selected season(s).
